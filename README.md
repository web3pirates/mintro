# Nudge - Smart, Sentiment-Aware Crypto Investing

Nudge is a Worldcoin Mini App that makes crypto investing simple, automated, and adaptive to market conditions. Users select a pre-built portfolio and set up a recurring buy using their credit card. From there, Nudge automates portfolio management ‚Äî shifting assets into USDC when market sentiment turns bearish, and redeploying when sentiment improves. While funds are in USDC, Nudge puts them to work in low-risk DeFi strategies to earn passive yield.
